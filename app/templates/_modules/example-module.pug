.modules

  .module
    p This is an example module. It can contain any content you need and is loaded from a separate .pug file.

  p The following tiles are generated by a Pug mixin. The only differences are the parameters we pass to it each time we call it â€“ in this case, <code>color</code> and <code>followup</code>.

  // Pug mixins are short html snippets that can recieve parameters, similar to Javascript functions or Sass mixins. 
  // Use them to keep your static html DRY (e.g. for product grids, article teasers, etc.)
  include /_modules/example-mixin

  // +colorblock('color', followup) // How to call this mixin.
  +colorblock                       // This defaults to "This is a mixin."
  +colorblock('lightyellow', true)  // This returns "This is another mixin." with a light yellow background.
  +colorblock('lightgreen')         // This defaults to "This is a mixin." with a light green background.
  +colorblock('lightblue',   true)  // This returns "This is another mixin." with a light blue background.
